# Sorting Numbers

Generate 4 random integers and sort them into 4 categories: multiples of 2, 3, 5, or 10.

Additionally, you can drop any of the 4 numbers into any categories, regardless of whether you are mathematically correct or otherwise. This is what makes it a game! Essentially, it is up to you to correctly sort the numbers into the right pile. 

Note that due to the particular number generator being used, random numbers can only be fetched once per minute.
